# identify
JS script to generate and assign students identification numbers
To generate and assign unique student identification numbers (IDs) in JavaScript, you can use a combination of alphanumeric characters and ensure uniqueness by tracking the generated IDs. One way to ensure uniqueness is by using a set to store the generated IDs and checking against it before assigning a new ID. 

In this script:

The generateRandomID function generates a random alphanumeric ID of a specified length.
The assignStudentIDs function takes a list of student objects and the desired length of the IDs.
It uses a Set named generatedIDs to store the generated IDs to ensure uniqueness.
For each student in the list, it generates a new ID until it finds a unique one not already in the set.
It assigns the generated ID to the student object and adds it to the set.
Finally, it demonstrates the usage by creating a list of students and assigning IDs to them, then displaying the students with their assigned IDs.
You can adjust the idLength parameter to specify the desired length of the generated IDs.
